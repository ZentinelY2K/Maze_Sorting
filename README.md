# Maze_Sorting
This program looks for '0's in a list, and replaces itself with it until it finds an exit from the Maze. It also gives you 'x' and 'y' along with a print statement if it runs into a wall

# Tech Stack
Python

# What i Learned:
Why variable reassignment is better than using .remove() and .insert() to replace elements inside a list, and trained my 2D liat manipulation and knowledge

# Why did i do it
For fun and to experiment with 2D lists

# Why i think it is worth publishing
I think it is satisfactory to see sorting algorithms like this, where you can see the indexes changing and shaping cleanly
